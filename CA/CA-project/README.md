# CA-project
This project involves simulating a fictional processor design using Java. The task is to implement a processor package consisting of 12 instructions with opcodes ranging from 0 to 11. The instruction set includes different formats (R-Format, I-Format, and J-Format) and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, branch instructions, logical operations, jump, shift instructions, load word, and store word. By simulating this processor design in Java, participants will gain practical experience in understanding processor functionality and executing instructions.
